## What Is It?

I'm building an interactive music guessing game where users identify songs from 5-second audio clips. The game will feature different music categories and integrate with the Deezer API to access a diverse music library.  

It's a web-based game that showcases:
- API integration  
- Audio handling  
- Interactive frontend development

## How Will This Enhance My Body of Work?

This adds an interactive, playable element to my portfolio that stands out from static projects.

It demonstrates:

- API integration with Deezer  
- Audio playback control and timing  
- Game logic and state management  
- UI/UX design for an engaging experience  
- Responsive web development  

Unlike typical portfolio pieces, this is something employers can actually play with. It makes the project more memorable and shows that I can build functional, enjoyable products.

## Where the Idea Came From

I've always been into music and realized I've never actually coded anything involving audio before.  

It seemed like a fun challenge to tackle something new while creating a project that's colorful and interactive. Plus, it's much more engaging than my other portfolio pieces — people can actually play it and have fun.

## Resources I Plan to Use

### Tech Stack

- Deezer API for music tracks and preview clips  
  - Initially, I wanted to use the Spotify API, but it is not available at the moment.  
- React for component-based UI  
- Tailwind CSS for styling  
- Vercel for deployment  

### Tools

- Figma for design mockups

## Fears, Uncertainties, and Doubts

- **API Rate Limits:** Deezer might limit requests during gameplay.  
- **Audio Playback Issues:** Different browsers (especially iOS Safari) handle audio differently.  
- **Difficulty Balancing:** Five seconds might be too easy or too hard depending on the song.  
  - I may need to select specific song portions (chorus vs. intro)  
  - Or add difficulty levels
